Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

        Block level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
        Inline element doesn't start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

        The element will no longer exist in the normal document layout flow. It sits in its own layer separate from everything else.


    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have 
    the ability to give it a width? 

        You use the property "box-sizing" and give it the value "border-box"

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline 
    by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

        3 elements that are display block by default:
            1.) <p>
            2.) <div>
            3.) <nav>
        2 elements that are display inline by default: 
            1.)<span>
            2.)<img>
        1 element that is display inline-block by default:
            <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, 
    in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

        The box model is the idea that every element on a webpage can operate as a box. It has four components:
            1.) Content (you edit this with width and height properties)
            2.) padding (space between content and border)
            3.) border
            4.) margin (space between border and outside)
        The fix for the box model is to use box-sizing: border-box in your univeral selector. 
        This makes the elements respect the width that you give them.
