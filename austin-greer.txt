            cd into the repo. 
            Afterwards, you need to change the branch. It will currently be on master. To do so you do this: git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'
            Now, you will need to push your branch onto github. To do that, you will type this: git push -u origin firstName-lastName
            Once your branch is on github, you will push all of your work to that branch. You will do the usual process of adding, committing and pushing to your branch.
            Once you have pushed your work, you will get on github and make a pull request.
            In the pull request, your branch will be the base.
            Add TL as reviewer.
            TL will count the work as done when he merges it back into master.
